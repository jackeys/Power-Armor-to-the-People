# Power Armor Sets

The following power armor sets are available, each with multiple modules to allow you to customize how they integrate with your game.

### All Lining Combinations
* This is a patch for the original armor set that allows it to spawn with all of its possible linings (e.g. Mk. I to Mk. VI)
* If you do not use this patch, enemies and legendary drops can only spawn as Mk I or Mk II, so it is recommended
