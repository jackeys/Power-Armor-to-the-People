In the 210 years since the bombs dropped, many besides the Sole Survivor have uncovered the power armor of the Old World. Some have only been able to scrap together the rusty pieces they have found until they break down, while others have learned the craft of upgrading power armor themselves to become formidable foes.

Power Armor to the People aims to incorporate many of the lore-friendly power armor sets available on the Nexus into the Commonwealth, making them feel like they are a part of the world. It imagines a world where power armor is a little more plentiful in the hands of the inhabitants of the Commonwealth, both as scavenged legendary items and on enemies who wear the suits themselves, and less commonly found abandoned. Effort has been taken to ensure that enemies who wear each set of power armor could plausibly have the armor.

The mod itself is a series of ESL-flagged ESPs, so if you don't like one of the features or you don't want to use some of the power armor sets, you don't have to. The installer contains patches for some common mods, and will auto-detect which ones you have to try and give you the best selection of patches for your setup automatically.

# Features

## Power Armored Enemies

With this feature installed, each selected power armor set will be given to certain enemies for the player to encounter. These enemies are still relatively uncommon, but you'll probably find at least one in most locations.

* Raiders are only able to scrap together what they can find, using mixed sets of rusted power armor
* Gunners have learned how to maintain and upgrade power armor, and have working sets of armor from the different offshoots of the US military and former US government
* The Institute has their own set of power armor
* The Brotherhood of Steel has an advanced set of power armor for their Star Paladins

For a full breakdown of which sets are available to each group of enemies at each level, see this article: [Spawn Levels and Locations](Spawn%20Levels%20and%20Locations.md)

*Requires [SweXavier05's Power Armored Enemies](https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/24635/)*

## Legendary Power Armor

With this feature installed, there is a small chance that any legendary item will be power armor. All of the base game effects are supported (with the exception of fall damage reduction), as well as the Far Harbor effects and a few effects that are exclusive to power armor in the base game.

For a full breakdown of what level each power armor set becomes available as a possible legendary drop, see this article: [Spawn Levels and Locations](Spawn%20Levels%20and%20Locations.md)

*Requires [Legendary Power Armor Pieces](https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/12834) and the Far Harbor DLC*

## Redistribute Power Armor

With this feature installed, the availability of each power armor set is changed. The full set that each power armor mod adds to the world is either removed or reduced to a partial set. This makes the hunt for each set of power armor more interesting, as you typically have to find the legendary pieces or fight an enemy wearing the armor to get it.

This also makes some power armor sets available for sale at vendors. For a full breakdown of which sets are available at which vendors, see this article: [Spawn Levels and Locations](Spawn%20Levels%20and%20Locations.md)

## Additional Patches

Patches are available for the following to add additional variety to power armored enemies:
* [X-01 Tesla Upgrade Kit](https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/27125)
* [Raider Overhaul](https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/9103)
* [Institute Heavy Weapons](https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/2441)

Patches are available for [AWKCR](https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/6091) as well, but that's for compatibility reasons - it does not add any additional features in relation to this mod.

# Highly Recommended Mods

These mods naturally fit into what Power Armor to the People is trying to achieve and are highly recommended to be included alongside it. These are the mods I play with, and patches are included in the installer to support those that need them:
* [Consistent Power Armor Overhaul](https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/11234) - Among other things, it adds a rusty T-51 texture which raiders can use
* [Brotherhood of Steel Power Armor Overhaul](https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/11978) - Gives the Brotherhood of Steel multiple types of power armor
* [Children of Atom Power Armor](https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/47586) - Unique variants and can be worn by the Children of Atom

## Some Assembly Required

The power armor scarcity of [Some Assembly Required](https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/12050) contributes greatly to the feeling that others in the wasteland have been scavenging the power armor sets. However, not every power armor set supported by Power Armor to the People has a patch to bring its repair, durability, and armor rating in line with Some Assembly Required. As such, the installer for Power Armor to the People has a plugin that provides only the scarcity aspects of Some Assembly Required. If the power armor sets you want to use all have patches for Some Assembly Required, go ahead and use the full version instead if you want the other changes.

The Atom Cats CPAO patch from Some Assembly Required is also highly recommended to make T-60 unique to the Brotherhood of Steel, whether you use the full version of Some Assembly Required or just the redistribution version included with Power Armor to the People.

# Installation

Use your preferred FOMOD-compatible mod manager, such as Vortex. The installer has many patches in it, which will auto-detect your current mods and should default to the correct set for your setup. You can also manually toggle each feature, power armor set, and patch to customize what you get, though features all show up together (e.g. if you choose both Power Armored Enemies and Legendary Power Armor and select three power armor sets, you will get both features for all three sets).

Once again, while the installer can install many patches to support your selection, all of these plugins are ESL-flagged ESPs that will not count against the normal ESP limit.

## Installing Mid-Playthrough

Power Armor to the People is intended to work with a new game, with each set of power armor set to show up at certain levels to provide a progression throughout the game, but this is not a requirement. Installing mid-playthrough should be safe, as this is how I have done most of my testing. **However,** there are some important things to keep in mind if you do this:

* Legendary power armor heavily leans in favour of giving you the strongest power armor set(s) available to you based on your level (>50%, with the exact chance depending on how many power armor sets you installed). If you install Power Armor to the People while you are already a high level, your chances of getting legendary power armor for a specific lower level set will be very low.
* If you have already obtained some of the power armor sets from around the world, you could skip some of the normal progression (e.g. with everything installed, it shouldn't be possible to get a full set of Hellfire X-03 until at least level 60, but you could have gotten this at a much lower level first)
* If you have already obtained some of the power armor sets from around the world, it's possible that some of the partial sets that replaced the full sets will respawn
