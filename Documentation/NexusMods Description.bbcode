Power Armor to the People aims to incorporate lore-friendly power armor mods into the world. Factions will wear appropriate power armor, vendors may occasionally have pieces for sale, and legendary pieces can sometimes be scavenged. The inhabitants of the Commonwealth have been scavenging for power armor for much longer than the Sole Survivor, so power armor will more frequently be found on enemies.

[b][size=3]For a full breakdown of where all of the power armor sets are distributed using each of these features, visit the [url=https://github.com/jackeys/Power-Armor-to-the-People/wiki]Power Armor to the People Wiki[/url].[/size][/b]

[size=4]Power Armored Enemies[/size][list]
[*]Raiders have scrapped together what power armor they could find, combining them with scrap metal and paint to intimidate and improvise additional defenses
[*]Gunners have learned how to maintain and upgrade power armor, and have access to an array of military power armor sets (including some from Enclave defectors)
[*]The Institute has their own set of power armor
[*]The Brotherhood of Steel has reclaimed power armor sets from throughout the world and from their fight with the Enclave, as well as a few special-built sets
[*]The Minutemen have been able to recover a few power armor sets, always wearing their colours and often foregoing a helmet to show they are of the people and for the people
[*]Scavengers are only able to scrap together what they can find, using mixed sets of rusted power armor
[*]A few individuals can be found who have discovered or modified special power armor sets
[*]Highly configurable spawn rates by faction and enemy type
[/list]
[size=4]Legendary Power Armor[/size]
There is a rare chance for legendary power armor to spawn in one of these ways:
[list]
[*]As a drop from legendary enemies
[*]As an equipped item on a power armored enemy (requires [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/42147]F4SE[/url])
[*]For a few sets, for sale at a vendor or redemption machine
[/list]
All of the base game effects are supported (with the exception of fall damage reduction), as well as the Far Harbor effects (with the appropriate patch) and a few effects that are exclusive to power armor in the base game.

[size=4]Vendor Integration[/size]
Some vendors will occasionally sell pieces of these power armor sets once the Sole Survivor reaches an appropriate level or meets some other condition.

[size=4]Abandoned Power Armor Changes[/size]
Most power armor mods add a way to get a full set of the power armor right from the start of the game. Power Armor to the People makes changes to this so that the sets fit into the progression when starting a new game, with full sets either removed, turned into partial sets, or moved behind locked doors depending on how high level the set is.

[b]Note:[/b] This feature does not affect Creation Club power armor, since they come with a quest to retrieve them and cost real money. I personally use [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/42753]Creation Club Delayed[/url] to offset this (thanks to jsalex for pointing this out).

[img]https://github.com/jackeys/Power-Armor-to-the-People/raw/master/Images/Mod%20Page/Recommended%20Mods%20Heading.png[/img]
These mods naturally fit into what Power Armor to the People is trying to achieve and are highly recommended to be included alongside it. These are the mods I play with, and patches are included in the installer to support those that need them:
[list]
[*][url=https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/11234]Consistent Power Armor Overhaul[/url] - Among other things, it adds a rusty T-51 texture which raiders can use[list]
[*]Note: If you are using AWKCR's Consistent Power Armor Overhaul replacer plugin, be sure to download the [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/50798?tab=files]rusty T-51 fix[/url]
[/list]
[*][url=https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/47586]Children of Atom Power Armor[/url] - Unique variants and can be worn by the Children of Atom
[*][url=https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/12050]Some Assembly Required[/url] - Makes power armor rare in the world, contributing to the feeling that people have been scavenging it for the last 210 years
[list]
[*]The No Stat Change version is recommended, as most of the power armor sets that Power Armor to the People supports do not have a Some Assembly Required patch to maintain balance between the sets
[*]If you do use the version that changes stats, and you use the Institute Power Armor patch, make sure to use version 1.0.1 or higher - version 1.0.0 causes a crash in conjunction with this mod
[/list][/list]

[img]https://github.com/jackeys/Power-Armor-to-the-People/raw/master/Images/Mod%20Page/Requirements%20Heading.png[/img]
Power Armor to the People has no hard requirements, and will work with only the base game. However, some features require other mods:
[list]
[*][url=https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/21497]Mod Configuration Menu[/url] allows you to configure many aspects of Power Armor to the People in-game
[*][url=https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/42147]F4SE[/url] is required for power armored enemies to be able to wear legendary power armor
[/list]
Since the main goal of Power Armor to the People is to incorporate other power armor mods into the world, it is highly recommended that you download all of the supported power armor sets that appeal to you to get the full experience.

[list=1]
[*]If you are installing mid-playthrough, it is recommended that you back up your saved game before adding new mods
[*]Install the power armor sets and other recommended mods that you want to use
[*]Use your preferred FOMOD-compatible mod manager, such as Vortex, to install Power Armor to the People

Since this mod has patches for so many other mods, it is really built on the shoulders of giants. Thank you to all of the mod authors who gave me permission to make patches for your work, and a special nod to AtomicTEM for uploading the No Stat Change version of Some Assembly Required at my request.
