# Lore-Based Power Armor Changes
**Compatibility Overview:** Highly compatible - balance issues and a single incompatibility if you use power armor mods that LBPAC does not have a patch for, one load order consideration

## Details

**Balance Issue:** Lore-Based Power Armor Changes (LBPAC) requires a patch for additional power armor sets to be consistent. These patches are not available for all of the same sets that Power Armor to the People supports, so it is recommended to only use sets that are supported by Lore-Based Power Armor Changes if you want to use them together.

**Incompatibility:** It is recommended that you do not use the X-01 Tesla Upgrade Kit patch for Power Armor to the People's Power Armored Enemies feature if you are using LBPAC. If you do, you will either see Tesla enemies in rusty X-01, breaking balance and immersion, or you will not get LBPAC's changes to X-01 power armor.

**Load Order:** Make sure LBPAC (or its AWKCR patch) is lower in your install order than LegendaryPAPieces and (if you are using AWKCR) the Legendary Power Armor AWKCR patch that comes packaged with Power Armor to the People.
