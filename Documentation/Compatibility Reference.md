# Lore-Based Power Armor Changes (Version 1.53)
**Compatibility Overview:** Partially compatible - some power armor worn by enemies won't have the changes applied, not every power armor set supported by Power Armor to the People has an LBPAC patch

* **Balance Issue:** Lore-Based Power Armor Changes (LBPAC) requires a patch for additional power armor sets to be consistent. These patches are not available for all of the same sets that Power Armor to the People supports, so it is recommended to only use sets that are supported by Lore-Based Power Armor Changes if you want to use them together.

* **Incompatibility:** The power armor worn by the Gunners will not have the changes from LBPAC. Additionally, X-01 Tesla Power Armor conflicts with LBPAC, and should be avoided if using LBPAC. If you really want to use it, place it lower than LBPAC which will remove the LBPAC changes to X-01.

# Raider Power Armor Improved (Version V004)
**Compatibility Overview:** Compatible

* **Load Order:** Make sure it is lower down than the LegendaryPAPieces - AWKCR Patch if you use that, as well as the AWKCR Engine Glitch Fix
