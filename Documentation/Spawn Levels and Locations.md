# Spawn Levels and Locations

## Legendary Power Armor
The following levels are when each of the power armor sets begin to drop from legendary enemies:
Level | Power Armor Set |
----- | ---------------
10 | _Raider Power Armor_, Excavator Power Armor
20 | _T-45_
30 | _T-51_, T-51c
40 | _T-60_, Institute Power Armor, Enclave X-02
50 | _X-01_
60 | T-65
70 | Hellfire X-03, Ultracite

* The levels indicated above show when the weakest lining for each piece of armor begins to drop. A stronger lining unlocks every 4 levels afterwards until all linings are available for that power armor set.
* The vanilla sets, shown in italics, are actually provided by the Legendary Power Armor Pieces mod - they are included here for completeness

## Power Armored Enemies
Each faction has different power armor sets that they can wear, with each faction having at least one unique set of power armor. There is typically a progression, based on enemy level, of stronger power armor sets.

### Raiders
Raiders use scavenged sets of power armor. They typically have rusty sets of power armor with mixed pieces from different sets.

Level | Power Armor Set
----- | ---------------
14    | _Raider Power Armor_, Excavator Power Armor, _T-45_
20    | T-51*
30    | _T-60*_

* T-51 is only available if using the Consistent Power Armor patch, as otherwise T-51 does not have a rusty version
* T-60 is excluded if using the Some Assembly Required Redistribution patch, since that makes T-60 exclusive to the Brotherhood of Steel
* If using either the Raider Overhaul or Raider Chop-Shop patch, these raiders will use the new paint jobs and upgrades as well
* The vanilla sets shown in italics are actually provided by SweXavier05's Power Armored Enemies mod - they are included here for completeness.

### Gunners
Gunners have access to power armor sets that were previously used by offshoots of the US military. They maintain and can partially upgrade their power armor for increased defense, and legendary Gunners will often have exclusive power armor sets or paint jobs.

Level | Power Armor Set | Enemy Type
----- | --------------- | ----------
20    | _T-45_, _T-51_, T-51c | All Gunners
30    | _T-60*_, Enclave X-02 | All Gunners
40    | X-01  | Legendary Gunners
50    | T-65 | Legendary Gunners
55    | Enclave X-02 Tesla | Legendary Gunners
60    | Hellfire X-03 | Legendary Gunners
65    | X-01 Tesla | Legendary Gunners

* T-60 is excluded if using the Some Assembly Required Redistribution patch, since that makes T-60 exclusive to the Brotherhood of Steel
* The vanilla sets shown in italics are actually provided by SweXavier05's Power Armored Enemies mod - they are included here for completeness.

### Brotherhood of Steel
In addition to the power armor that the Brotherhood of Steel typically have, the following additional sets are available to them:

Level | Power Armor Set | Enemy Type
----- | --------------- | ----------
67    | Ultracite Power Armor | Star Paladins

### Institute
With power armor in the hands of the raider factions on the surface, the Institute has developed their own power armor to ensure they can continue to accomplish their goals. Legendary synths who don this armor also carry synth relay grenades to overwhelm their enemies.

Level | Power Armor Set | Enemy Type
----- | --------------- | ----------
30    | Institute Power Armor | Synths

## Power Armor Redistribution

### Vendors

Some power armor sets are available at vendors when using the "Redistribute Power Armor" feature. Full sets are not guaranteed, so you may have to come back a few times to get the full set after the vendor's inventory refreshes.

Power Armor Set | Location | Conditions
--------------- | -------- | ----------
Institute Power Armor | The Institute - Requisitions | Allied with The Institute
Ultracite Power Armor | The Prydwyn - Proctor Teagan | Promoted to Sentinel
Classic Advanced Power Armor | The Prydwyn - Proctor Teagon, Atom Cats Garage | Level 55
