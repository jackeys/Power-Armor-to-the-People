# Spawn Levels and Locations

## Legendary Power Armor
The following levels are when each of the power armor sets begin to drop from legendary enemies:
Level | Power Armor Set
----- | ---------------
10    | _Raider Power Armor_, Excavator Power Armor
20    | _T-45_
30    | _T-51_, T-51c
40    | _T-60_, Institute Power Armor, Enclave X-02
50    | _X-01_, X-02 (CC), Hellfire (CC)
60    | T-65
70    | Hellfire X-03, Ultracite

* The levels indicated above show when the weakest lining for each piece of armor begins to drop. A stronger lining unlocks every 4 levels afterwards until all linings are available for that power armor set.
* The vanilla sets, shown in italics, are actually provided by the Legendary Power Armor Pieces mod - they are included here for completeness

### Drop Rates
By default, each legendary item has a 50% chance of being a weapon, a 40% chance of being armor, and a 10% chance of being power armor. If you are using Mod Configuration Menu, you can adjust the split between armor and power armor, but weapons will always make up 50% of the legendary drops.

### Equipped Legendary Power Armor

**This feature requires Fallout 4 Script Extender (F4SE).**

Each power armored enemy has a chance that one of the pieces of power armor they are wearing will be legendary. This will be one of the pieces they are normally wearing, so if you fight an enemy in X-02, a piece of that X-02 set would be legendary. See the below section on Power Armored Enemies to see which enemies can wear each set and at what level.

By default, normal power armored enemies have a 5% chance of having a legendary power armor piece equipped, and legendary power armored enemies have a 20% chance of having a legendary power armor piece equipped in addition to the normal legendary item they drop. If you are using Mod Configuration Menu, you can adjust these chances.

Because of a bug with the Institute Power Armor, equipped Institute power armor torsos cannot be legendary. Turning them into legendary items causes them to temporarily be unequipped, and when this happens, the arms and legs all turn invisible, so I disabled them. 

## Power Armored Enemies
Each faction has different power armor sets that they can wear, with each faction having at least one unique set of power armor. There is typically a progression, based on enemy level, of stronger power armor sets.

### Raiders
Raiders use scavenged sets of power armor. They typically have rusty sets of power armor with mixed pieces from different sets.

Level | Power Armor Set
----- | ---------------
14    | _Raider Power Armor_, Excavator Power Armor, _T-45_
20    | T-51*
30    | _T-60*_
40    | X-01 (rare, individual pieces only)
60    | X-03 (rare, individual pieces only)

* T-51 is only available if using the Consistent Power Armor patch, as otherwise T-51 does not have a rusty version
* T-60 is excluded if using the Some Assembly Required Redistribution patch, since that makes T-60 exclusive to the Brotherhood of Steel
* If using either the Raider Overhaul or Raider Chop-Shop patch, these raiders will use the new paint jobs and upgrades as well
* The vanilla sets shown in italics are actually provided by SweXavier05's Power Armored Enemies mod - they are included here for completeness.

### Gunners
Gunners have access to power armor sets that were previously used by offshoots of the US military. They maintain and can partially upgrade their power armor for increased defense, and legendary Gunners will often have exclusive power armor sets or paint jobs.

Level | Power Armor Set                          | Enemy Type
----- | ---------------------------------------- | ----------
20    | _T-45_, _T-51_, T-51c                    | All Gunners
30    | _T-60*_, Enclave X-02                    | All Gunners
40    | X-01, X-02 (CC), Hellfire (CC)           | Legendary Gunners
50    | T-65                                     | Legendary Gunners
55    | Enclave X-02 Tesla                       | Legendary Gunners
60    | Hellfire X-03                            | Legendary Gunners
65    | X-01 Tesla, Classic Advanced Power Armor | Legendary Gunners

* T-60 is excluded if using the Some Assembly Required Redistribution patch, since that makes T-60 exclusive to the Brotherhood of Steel
* The vanilla sets shown in italics are actually provided by SweXavier05's Power Armored Enemies mod - they are included here for completeness.

### Brotherhood of Steel
The Brotherhood of Steel have made it their mission to reclaim and repair pre-war technology. They have also reclaimed technology created by the Enclave from the Capitol Wasteland. All power armor sets reclaimed by the Brotherhood of Steel are painted to allow for immediate recognition.

Level | Power Armor Set                 | Rank
----- | ------------------------------- | ------------
--    | _T-45_                          | Knight
--    | _T-51_                          | Knight Captain
--    | _T-60_                          | Paladin and higher
--    | _X-01_                          | Elder
30    | Enclave X-02*                   | Knight and higher*
40    | X-01*, X-02 (CC), Hellfire (CC) | Paladin and higher*
50    | T-65                            | Paladin and higher*
60    | Hellfire X-03*                  | Paladin and higher*
67    | Ultracite Power Armor           | Star Paladin

* Sets shown in italics are actually provided by the Brotherhood Power Armor Overhaul mod, if you are using that - they are included here for completeness
* Without Brotherhood Power Armor Overhaul and the BPAO patch for Power Armored Enemies, only Ultracite Power Armor applies to a specific rank
* By default, T-60 (or the ranked equivalent from Brotherhood Power Armor Overhaul) is much more likely than any of the newly added sets, but this can be adjusted if you are using Mod Configuration Menu
* X-01 is only available if using the X-01 for BoS patch, which is only recommended if you are using Brotherhood Power Armor Overhaul or AWKCR so the appropriate paint job is available
* Enclave X-02 is only available if using the X-02 All Factions Paintjob patch
* Hellfire X-03 is only available if using the X-03 All Factions Paintjob patch

### Institute
With power armor in the hands of the raider factions on the surface, the Institute has developed their own power armor to ensure they can continue to accomplish their goals. Legendary synths who don this armor also carry synth relay grenades to overwhelm their enemies.

Level | Power Armor Set       | Enemy Type
----- | --------------------- | ----------
30    | Institute Power Armor | Synths

## Power Armor Redistribution

### Vendors

Some power armor sets are available at vendors when using the "Redistribute Power Armor" feature. Full sets are not guaranteed, so you may have to come back a few times to get the full set after the vendor's inventory refreshes.

Power Armor Set              | Location                                       | Conditions
---------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- | ----------
Institute Power Armor        | The Institute - Requisitions                   | Allied with The Institute
Ultracite Power Armor        | The Prydwyn - Proctor Teagan                   | Promoted to Sentinel
Classic Advanced Power Armor | The Prydwyn - Proctor Teagon, Atom Cats Garage | Level 55
