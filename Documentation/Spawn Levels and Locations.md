# Spawn Levels and Locations

## Legendary Power Armor
The following levels are when each of the power armor sets begin to drop from legendary enemies:
Level | Power Armor Set
----- | ---------------
1     | Raider Power Armor, Excavator Power Armor
7     | T-45
14    | T-51, T-51c
21    | T-60, Institute Power Armor, Enclave X-02
28    | X-01, X-02 (CC), Hellfire (CC), Hellfire X-03
35    | T-65
42    | Classic Advanced Power Armor, Ultracite

* The levels indicated above show when the weakest lining for each piece of armor begins to drop. A stronger lining unlocks every 4 levels afterwards until all linings are available for that power armor set.

### Drop Rates
By default, each legendary item has a 50% chance of being a weapon, a 40% chance of being armor, and a 10% chance of being power armor. If you are using Mod Configuration Menu, you can adjust the split between armor and power armor, but weapons will always make up 50% of the legendary drops.

### Equipped Legendary Power Armor

**This feature requires Fallout 4 Script Extender (F4SE).**

Each power armored enemy has a chance that one of the pieces of power armor they are wearing will be legendary. This will be one of the pieces they are normally wearing, so if you fight an enemy in X-02, a piece of that X-02 set would be legendary. See the below section on Power Armored Enemies to see which enemies can wear each set and at what level.

By default, normal power armored enemies have a 5% chance of having a legendary power armor piece equipped, and legendary power armored enemies have a 20% chance of having a legendary power armor piece equipped in addition to the normal legendary item they drop. If you are using Mod Configuration Menu, you can adjust these chances.

Because of a bug with the Institute Power Armor, equipped Institute power armor torsos cannot be legendary. Turning them into legendary items causes them to temporarily be unequipped, and when this happens, the arms and legs all turn invisible, so I disabled them. 

### Captain Cosmos Redemption Machine
If you own the Captain Cosmos Creation Club content, the redemption machines have a chance to provide legendary CC-00 power armor and Cosmic Cannons. By default, there is a 10% chance of getting a legendary with each redemption. If you are using Mod Configuration Menu, you can adjust this chance.

## Power Armored Enemies
Each faction has different power armor sets that they can wear, with each faction having at least one unique set of power armor. There is typically a progression, based on enemy level, of stronger power armor sets.

### Raiders
Raiders use scavenged sets of power armor. They typically have rusty sets of power armor with mixed pieces from different sets.

Level | Power Armor Set
----- | ---------------
11    | Raider Power Armor, Excavator Power Armor, T-45
18    | T-51*
25    | T-60*, Horse Power Armor (rare, individual pieces only)
32    | X-01 (rare, individual pieces only), X-02 CC* (rare), X-03 (rare, individual pieces only)
39    | T-65 (rare, individual pieces only - only arms and legs)

* T-51 is not included by default, but is configurable - it is recommended if you are using Consistent Power Armor, which adds a rusty version
* T-60 can be turned off in the configuration, since Some Assembly Required makes T-60 exclusive to the Brotherhood of Steel
* X-02 Creation Club must be turned on in the configuration, as this is only applicable if you are using the X02 Raider Power Armor mod that replaces the normal X-02 set with a raider version
* If using either the Raider Overhaul or Raider Chop-Shop patch, these raiders will use the new paint jobs and upgrades as well

### Gunners
Gunners have access to power armor sets that were previously used by offshoots of the US military. They maintain and can partially upgrade their power armor for increased defense, and legendary Gunners will often have exclusive power armor sets or paint jobs.

Level | Power Armor Set                                | Enemy Type
----- | ---------------------------------------------- | ----------
18    | T-45, T-51, T-51c                              | All Gunners
25    | T-60*, Enclave X-02                            | All Gunners
32    | X-01, X-02 (CC)*, Hellfire (CC), Hellfire X-03 | Legendary Gunners
39    | T-65                                           | Legendary Gunners
46    | Classic Advanced Power Armor                   | Legendary Gunners
50    | X-01 Tesla, Enclave X-02 Tesla                 | Legendary Gunners

* T-60 can be turned off in the configuration, since Some Assembly Required makes T-60 exclusive to the Brotherhood of Steel
* If the setting to give X-02 Creation Club to raiders is used, it will not be available to Gunners - the X02 Raider Power Armor mod replaces the standard set with a Raider version

### Brotherhood of Steel
The Brotherhood of Steel have made it their mission to reclaim and repair pre-war technology. They have also reclaimed technology created by the Enclave from the Capitol Wasteland. All power armor sets reclaimed by the Brotherhood of Steel are painted to allow for immediate recognition.

Level | Power Armor Set                      | Rank
----- | ------------------------------------ | ------------
--    | _T-45_                               | Knight
--    | _T-51_                               | Knight Captain
--    | T-60                                 | Paladin and higher
--    | _X-01_                               | Elder
25    | Enclave X-02*                        | Knight and higher*
32    | X-01*, Hellfire (CC), Hellfire X-03* | Paladin and higher*
39    | T-65                                 | Paladin and higher*
67    | Ultracite Power Armor                | Star Paladin

* Sets shown in italics are actually provided by the Brotherhood Power Armor Overhaul mod, if you are using that - they are included here for completeness
* Without Brotherhood Power Armor Overhaul and the BPAO patch for Power Armored Enemies, only Ultracite Power Armor applies to a specific rank
* By default, T-60 (or the ranked equivalent from Brotherhood Power Armor Overhaul) is much more likely than any of the newly added sets, but this can be adjusted if you are using Mod Configuration Menu
* X-01 is not included by default, but is configurable - it is only recommended if you are using Brotherhood Power Armor Overhaul or AWKCR so the appropriate paint job is available
* Enclave X-02 is only available if using the X-02 All Factions Paintjob patch
* Hellfire X-03 is only available if using the X-03 All Factions Paintjob patch

### Institute
With power armor in the hands of the raider factions on the surface, the Institute has developed their own power armor to ensure they can continue to accomplish their goals. Legendary synths who don this armor also carry synth relay grenades to overwhelm their enemies.

Level | Power Armor Set       | Enemy Type
----- | --------------------- | ----------
25    | Institute Power Armor | Synths

### Unique Enemies
In addition to the standard enemies who can wear power armor, there are some unique enemies wearing special sets. These enemies can only be encountered once, and they usually only show up once the player has reached a certain level.

Name          | Power Armor Set        | Location          | Level They First Appear
------------- | ---------------------- | ----------------- | -----------------------
Scavenger     | CC-00 (Creation Club)  | Hubris TV Studios | 1
Sojourner     | Chosen One Classic APA | Libertalia        | 50

## Vendors

Some power armor sets are available at vendors. A vendor will typically only have a few pieces available at any given time - you will have to come back a few times to get a full set.

* Enclave X-02 is only available at the Brotherhood of Steel if using the All Factions Paintjob patch that gives the Brotherhood painted sets for their Knights and Paladins
* If using Some Assembly Required, the Atom Cats mostly carry T-45 instead of the items in the table above

## Abandoned Power Armor

Location                                       | Power Armor Set       | Condition

* There is a configuration setting to permanently restore the power armor placement from the original mods, in which case the above table does not apply. For power armor sets that were replaced with a unique enemy, this means the unique enemy will show up regardless of player level.
* The bunker west of the Glowing Sea Vertibird Wreckage is added by the Hellfire X-03 mod, and is only available if that mod is installed

### Leveled Enclave Set

A leveled Enclave set will include the highest level power armor set that is installed from this list:

Power Armor Set              | Level
---------------------------- | -----
Enclave X-02                 | 21
X-01, Hellfire X-03          | 28
Classic Advanced Power Armor | 42

* If the set is found at a lower level, it will have the lowest leveled that is currently available
