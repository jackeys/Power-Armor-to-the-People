# Spawn Levels and Locations

## Legendary Power Armor
The following levels are when each of the power armor sets begin to drop from legendary enemies:
Level | Power Armor Set |
----- | ---------------
10 | _Raider Power Armor_
20 | _T-45_
30 | _T-51_, T-51c
40 | _T-60_, Institute Power Armor
50 | _X-01_
60 | Enclave X-02
70 | Hellfire X-03
80 | Ultracite

* The levels indicated above show when the weakest lining for each piece of armor begins to drop. A stronger lining unlocks every 4 levels afterwards until all linings are available for that power armor set.
* The vanilla sets, shown in italics, are actually provided by the Legendary Power Armor Pieces mod - they are included here for completeness
