# Power Armor to the People

Power Armor to the People is a Fallout 4 mod aimed at integrating other Power Armor mods into the world, making them feel like a natural part of the game. It primarily does this by:
* Making power armor available as a legendary drop
* Adding more enemies that wear power armor
* Removing the single full set typical of power armor mods

The mod is a series of ESL-flagged ESPs that patch together and enhance features from the mods it aims to integrate.
